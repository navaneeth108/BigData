## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

	Pyhton is a general purpose language since it can be used for a verity of technical requirements and python language 
	allows a programmer to write the programs which are independent of a particular type of computer which makes it a high level language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
	In python it is not necessary for us to specify the data type while declaring the variable which makes it dynamically typed language.
	Python is able to handle this by its own.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
	Pros: easy to read and understand, huge verity of librery support, exellent for data related works.
	Cons: higer runtime, more memmory consuption, no multitheading.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
	Web application, Game Development, ML Applications, AI applications, Data Science

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
	Variable is a specific memory location we create to which we can assign values.
	we need declare a varible by assigning a name and a value for it, eg: x=3.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
	Var = input()

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
	String

Q8. What is type casting?
	It is the process of changeing the datatype of a particular variable, eg: Var = int(x)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
	Input() function can only take one input at a time but we can use loops to take mutiple input or use string.

Q10. What are keywords?
	 They are the reserved words in Python which we cannot use for naming any variable or function.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
	No, They are the reserved words used by pyhton.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
	Indentation is a space given before writing a line of code. They are used define the scope/end of a code or functions.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
	We can use the function print() to throw some output in Python
	

Q14. What are operators in Python?
 Operators are special charenters that helps to carry out arithmetic and logical operations

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
	/ will perform a floating point division, which will give answer contains any decimal points.
	//  operator is a integer division which provide a rounded the answer, which is a floor division

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
print("```")
print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")
print("```")

	

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

num = int(input())

if num%2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?

These are words used as conjuctions where we need to execute one or more logical expressions to include or exclude data to get a more focused result.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 ->

0 and 0   

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

1
0
False
1


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

	These statements (IfElse, Elif, Nested If ) directs the execution of the statements mentioned as a part of it. Basically these can 
        be used to execute certain statements of the code on basisi of some conditions.


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

		They are conditional statement, usded perform logic based on given conditions

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
